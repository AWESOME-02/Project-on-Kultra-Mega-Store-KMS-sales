# DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT USING SQL
## Overview
This project presents a structured SQL-based analysis of KMS Company’s sales data. The goal is to analyze the data from 2009 to 2012 and present key insights and findings to support the Abuja division management decisions on profitability, shipping efficiency, customer value, and returns.
Using my analytical thinking and all that I have learned from Digital SkillUp Africa, I was able to analyze that data using structured Query Language (SQL). 
Structuring SQL queries to extract insights (like identifying returned items by segment or aligning shipping cost with order priority) challenged my logic and taught me how to think more like a business analyst.
## SQL commands/clauses used include:
- Sum
- And/Or
- Count 
- Group by 
- Order by 
- Join
- Create view
